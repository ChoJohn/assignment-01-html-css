# Reflection

In this assignment you've learned very basic HTML and CSS, the content and presentation layers of the web. Take this opportunity to think about how they might relate to your work as a historian.

## Question 1 (150 words)
#### In Part 2, we explored the use of semantic elements such as ~<header>~, ~<article>~, and ~<section>~. These elements make it easier for machines and non-visual browsers to navigate web pages. Why might this be important? (You might want to google around a bit before answering!)
They are all important because they are all designed to do a specific thing.

Header - The header is used to define the header of the document or section. It is commonly used to introduce a content

Article - Article is used to when content is independent. Like the name suggest, it is most commonly used for posts, and articles.

Section - The section tag defines a section in a document. It is used to group content. It is an easy way to split up the contents of the website.

To design a website, it is crucial to organize the structure correctly. Once the webpage is correctly structured, CSS can help bring the webpage alive. However, the semantic tags are important factors when build the foundation of the webpage. The semantic tags are also an important thing because coders who work on a project they haven't seen before could understand and visually see the webpage without rendering it.

## Question 2 (150 words)
#### In your CSS work, you learned how to change the presentation of material on the web without changing the content. Using a pen and paper, a drawing program, or (if you're feeling ambitious) real HTML and CSS, mock up 2 very different presentations of the information you displayed in your post. Put images of them on the Internet somewhere (but not in this repository) and link to them here. Write a brief paragraph discussing the effect of the presentaiton layer on the reader.  

I think these designs are useful to deliver the information in a creative but also informative way. With the two designs, you are about to get context of the person but also a visual of either the time of the events, or the location of the events.

Through the map design, you are able to follow the historic figure through their adventures. For example, I chose Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He moved around in Europe. With the map design, you are able to locate where he was born to his death. We could also add the location of his performances.

The timeline design allows users to view what event occured where in the historic figure's life. Users are able to follow along from his birth to his death and visually be able to see the impact of the historic figure's actions. Displaying the information in a timeline also allows users to easily observe the most impactful moments of the historic figure's life. For example, if the person has made a lot of actions when the person is 40, users will be able to observe that that year was the most impactful. Which allow users to understand the significance of that year and possibly see the bigger picture.
