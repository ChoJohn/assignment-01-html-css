              <strong>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</strong> was born on January 27, 1756. He started off as a pianist in Vienna. He quickly became known for his talents on the piano. Soon after, he excelled as a composer. After his work of the opera, <em>Die Entf√ºhrung aus dem Serail (The Abduction from the Seraglio)</em>, he built his reputation as a composer.

              His career was successful however, his love life was not. When he got rejected by Aloysia, Mozart decided to move on to Aloysia's sister, Constanze. Mozart and Constanze did not work out as smoothly as he hoped. They separated and when they finally got back together, he had a difficult time getting Constanze's father's permission for marriage. They decided to get married the day before the father's consent arrived in the mail. The Mozarts had six children but only two survived infancy.

              After all the hardship through his personal life, he lived a lavishing life. He lived in an exclusive apartment. He sent his kids to the most expensive schools. Mozart produced and performed in small venues since huge concert halls had complications. However, this all vanished as he performed less and was in financial difficulties. He died at the age of 35.
